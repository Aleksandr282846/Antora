Hello

My IDEP wallet address: idep1hghlzgcar7rces6dlknrgkyfka4pzd58m0qujg

   My name is Nijat Mayilov, from Azerbaijan.
   
I want to be a validator for IDEP blockhain.
What I've done so far:
 
I created a decentralized website on one of Cosmos blockchains, Akash network
( https://twitter.com/nijatoes/status/1492680289813995521?t=BoaVmAkNDXKfcQmPnthqqw&s=19

Testnets I joined or contribute:  Umee, Taiga, Ironfish, Aptos, Starknet, QAN, Suberra, Axelar, Zksyc, Massa

To be honest, this will be my first experience in mainnet blockchain validation. But I have a lot of experience with testnets. Also I have a lot of knowledge about PoS algorithms, linux servers, bare metal / dedicated servers, aws, multi cloud and cpu architectures. So I can handle this task as well.
