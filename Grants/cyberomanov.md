I'm Community Lead in IDEP discord.

I'm https://t.me/IDEP_RU creator and owner. It's local thematic russian chat about IDEP.

I'm https://cyberomanov.tech/IDEP creator. It's guide about SanfordV2 testnet.

I'm IDEP early supporter. I support IDEP since the first testnet phase and I guess I deserve to get a grant, despite the fact that I'm already a genesis validator.
