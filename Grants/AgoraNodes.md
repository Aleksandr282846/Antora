Introduction

Hey, we are AgoraNodes

We are small team who has self funded ourselves. We are privacy advocates so we are passionate about projects that help bring privacy and security to the forefront. When it comes to our validator nodes, they perform exceptionally. We are a small team without the resources that many of the bigger node operators may have but we can run our nodes just as well if not better. We donâ€™t expect you to believe us because of our words but because of our results, so you can try our competence and devotion to our work. We are easy to reach and easy to work with. This is a project we had been looking forward to and are excited to work with everyone contributing if given the opportunity.
