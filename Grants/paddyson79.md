Dear IDEP Team,

Dear IDEP team, we are applying for a grant to become mainnet validators. Pathrocknetwork is a staking as a service provider, running secure and reliable validators and nodes for interesting blockchain projects. Currently we support more than 20 different mainnet protocols. Among these are not only Cosmos / Tendermint based projects like Agoric, Nymtech, Polygon / Matic and others, but also well respected projects like Moonbeam, Minaprotocol and Nearprotocol. A full list of our mainnet nodes can be viewed here: [https://pathrocknetwork.org/](https://pathrocknetwork.org/ "https://pathrocknetwork.org/")

As a young startup we try to get into projects early and support where we can. We also bring additional value to projects we run validators for through our own partnership with ALTER [https://altermail.live/](https://altermail.live/ "https://altermail.live/") a private and secure messaging platform built on the Secret Network and their Stake2Access approach. You can find more information regarding [Stake-to-Access here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/163h5_Ywa4NhvZPk3GGqoEoyj4l0e4zzp/view "https://drive.google.com/file/d/163h5_Ywa4NhvZPk3GGqoEoyj4l0e4zzp/view") And there's also a recently published blog post announcing the [beta launch ](https://scrt.network/blog/secret-feature-alter-stake-to-access "https://scrt.network/blog/secret-feature-alter-stake-to-access") Feel free to get in touch with any additional questions. We hope to be able to receive a grant and help secure the network
