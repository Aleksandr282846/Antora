## Why should I receive a grant?

I am a supporter of the project, I have been participating in it for a long time. I had the role of "Sanford". I successfully started node and created a validator. Throughout the testnet, I monitored the uptime of the node and the validator. Developed a prototype [concept model](https://twitter.com/yashchegolev/status/1512549005410062345) of the IDEP headquarters building. Understood with SGX technology. I plan to continue to participate in the project and work together on the development of the project. Together we will do it!
