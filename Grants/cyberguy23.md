Hello, 

this is cyberguy23 applying for the Antora network grant to becone a validator. I have been following the project for almost a year now and have actively participated in all testnets. I am very interested in the concept of the network and would be happy to become a mainnet validator in future. 

Please issue tokens for creating a validator to the address: idep1qfw8r9cpe4dufs3u0fpqr258nw5s25mcn6k8ft

Cheers!
