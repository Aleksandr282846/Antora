Hello)))
My name is Mykola Toma
My Moniker: StolenKrown
My IDEP address: idep1pn5e4530ksksm2d05n5kxvgajurq5x3tz4af4x

My validator experience is very modest about 6 months, and therefore I cannot boast of any achievements in terms of validation in the mainnet, but this is not a reason to refuse me, because there's a first time for everything)
Testnet validator such as:
1. KYVE Network - https://kyve.explorers.guru/validator/kyvevaloper1md6mg0d03yjczfc0azcw4em7tgur8tu27xk3gt
2. In the past was a validator on Evmos
3. And accordingly was validator each IDEP test network
n. Also was a validator at Archway, DeFund, Crescent, Sei. But as it is clear, it made little sense :D

In the end, I would like to wish good luck to your team, because the path was hard)
