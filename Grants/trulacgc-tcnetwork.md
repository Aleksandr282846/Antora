We are very interested in running a validator on IDEP Network.

Currently we already joined as Mainnet validators on some chains: Evmos, Gravity Bridge, Nomic, Desmos, Dig, Odin, Certik, Agoric, Galaxy, Cerberus, ChiHuaHua and Crescent. And also participated in some testnet including Anone, Cosmic Horizon, Defund, Sei Network, and QuickSilver.
 
This is my website (https://tcnetwork.io) where you can get more information about me and my team. 

Please look at my github (https://github.com/trulacgc-tcnetwork) to see my activity and contribution to the cosmos ecosystem.
