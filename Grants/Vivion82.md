Hello, my name is Ruslan, I'm from Kazakhstan.

My IDEP Wallet:
idep1v3rwmtm7qegc8kr9mwts62ngmxxw80ft8z36wp

My main activity is the maintenance of industrial equipment and the automation of the technological process.
For the past 3 years I have been studying blockchains and their various networks. To be honest, I have never participated in the mainnet.
But he took part in various test networks. He also actively participated in the Sanford testnets, Sanford2 was a validator.
