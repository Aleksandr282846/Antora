Hello, my name is Ruslan, I'm from Kazakhstan.

My IDEP Wallet:

My main activity is the maintenance of industrial equipment and the automation of the technological process.
For the past 3 years I have been studying blockchains and their various networks. To be honest, I have never participated in the mainnet.
But he took part in various test networks. He also actively participated in the Sanford testnets, Sanford2 was a validator.
Actively participated in networks (hopr_tesnet_Matterhorn,
archway
Asset mantle
Automata Network
Celestia
KYVE

Minima.

The community is also very responsive, I am very glad that I was one of the members of the IDep test networks. I hope I will become a member of the IDEP team.
