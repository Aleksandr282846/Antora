-Hi great IdEP team.
-To be honest, I have never been a validator anywhere.There is a reason for this, of course, and I did not come across the right project.I did not apply for it
-As i saw your site for the first time i realized that everything is great.:) I love you *3000* IdEP


-Testnets I've joined:Evmos Cosmic Horizon Umee Sei Axelar Taiga  Massa Aptos Starknet Zksyc Forta Quicksilver Manta Kyve  and other projects i forgot
-İgnite tournaments--->Fire starter,Ambassador,Tester
-Firefly--->Tester
-Maybe that's all
-I think everything will be great for IdEP.I would be proud to take part in such a project.
