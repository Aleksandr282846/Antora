# About
StarShell is a free and open-source, non-custodial Web3 wallet designed to run as a browser extension for both desktop and mobile (yes, it works as a browser extension on mobile with Firefox for Android and Safari for iOS!). Our core values are about protecting user privacy, empowering data ownership, and broadening accessibility; ideals that we believe strongly align with the Web3 philosophy.

# Coming to IDEP
With IDEP's plans to fork Secret Network for its privacy features, we're looking forward to adding support for the chain and raising the IBC gang synergy. StarShell is currently evaluating which chains it will support at launch. We provide all of our own node infrastructure for broadcasting transactions on behalf of wallet users, as well as a suite of web services for VIP users.

# Infrastructure
We are currently setting up new bare metal machines across several data centers across the globe packed with the latest Xeon E-2388G processors for SGX support on IDEP and Secret Network. Due to the amount of traffic we expect to handle as wallet providers, we have developed a state-of-the-art load-balancing, auto-scaling, self-healing infrastructure as code with intelligent backup/restore and key management. Our validators use horcrux with a 3/5 threshold configuration for high redundancy (meaning 2/5 validators could be offline and we will still be signing blocks).

# Contributing Value to IDEP
We believe that partnering with IDEP at this stage by receiving funding will be crucical in helping us offset our node infrastructure costs on behalf of end users, and in return, we intend to bring new users to the chain by shipping with IDEP support built-in to the wallet.
