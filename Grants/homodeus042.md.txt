First of all, hello, I am happy to be in your project. I worked as a validator in many projects, of course, these were projects that continued for months in the testing process.
I give importance to cosmos projects and there are many projects that I am currently running node on.
I help people with additional nodes and help solve their problems. I will do my best to strengthen your project.

I will leave the nodes as validator;
