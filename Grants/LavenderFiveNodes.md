## Who We Are

Lavender.Fives Nodes (https://www.lavenderfive.com/) is one of the most trusted validators in the cosmos ecosystem. 
Our team is able to maintain near-100% uptime through a variety of resources including dedicated servers around the world, 
multiple 24/7 alerting systems in place, and always-ready backup servers. 
We are proud to say we serve as validators on more than 30 mainnets, and are trusted by over 10000 delegators. 

We differentiate ourselves through our community engagement and contributions to the projects we serve. 
This is achieved by authoring documentation for fellow validators, writing and promoting new governance proposals, 
and helping squash code bugs before they become an issue.

## Our Infrastructure

We take a pragmatic approach to running validators. At the most basic level we utilize bare metal servers
with a minimum of 2 full nodes per network. At a minimum the nodes are in different data centers, but commonly
are by different providers distributed around the world. In addition, we utilize [Horcrux](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux) 
as our remote signing solution, with 3 signers. What this means in practice is *ALL* nodes have to go down, or 2 signers, before 
we miss blocks.

In addition to this, we utilize the following as our monitoring solutions:
- [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/)
- [Tenderduty](https://github.com/blockpane/tenderduty)
- [PANIC](https://github.com/SimplyVC/panic)
- [HalfLife](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/half-life)

## Our Contributions

We also contribute greatly to each ecosystem we're in. As a few off the cuff examples:
