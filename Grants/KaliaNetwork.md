## About Us
[Kalia Network](https://kalia.network/) is a professional validator in Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies, the most up-to-date infrastructure solution provider for the new generation of blockchain technologies PoS.

### Our Mission
Kalia Network aims to contribute to projects in many areas where needed.

- To provide a seamlessly infrastructure service for Proof of Stake blockchains in terms of reliability.
- To provide our delegators to earn their stake rewards seamlessly and without interruption

### Our Technical Know-How
With more than 10 years of experience in the software industry, we entered the blockchain world in 2020. We have been involved in many projects in the blockchain world and we continue to do so. We are testing projects before the mainnet and supporting to projects. On the other hand, we have been developing own products. These products aim to contribute to projects.

We are working with a single-node validator. We are also running a backup node. If there occurs any error on the active node, we immediately install from the backup node. This allows us to avoid the penalty for inconsistency (double signing) while maintaining a near-perfect 100% uptime.

### As summarize our keywords;
- 100% refund in case of any downtime
- 98%+ uptime
- High Performance Dedicated server
- High Security
- A team of experienced engineers

## Our Contributions:
We are developing a project for governance, which is one of the most important issues, we have developed for the Cosmos ecosystem. We look forward to integrating it into the chains we have validated in the Cosmos ecosystem soon. Apart from this, we aim to make a great contribution to every ecosystem we are in. A few examples: 

- Providing RPC & snapshots services & relayers,
- Developing some bots for Discord & Telegram
- Participation in the testnet of projects which we are validating
- Giving technical support for node runners in Discord
- Working in Telegram and Discord as ambassador in global language and languages of some regions.

Apart from these, we have a project for governance that we are currently developing for the Cosmos ecosystem. We don't want to post here publicly for copyright reasons. We'll talk about the details privately.

Best Regards,
